![hostgator-logo](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/hostgator-logo-150x150.gif)There are three kinds of hosting companies - small, big & huge. Small companies host hundreds of domains. Big companies host thousands of domains and huge companies host over lakhs of domains. HostGator fails in third type, it hosts more than18lakh domains!  I am sure heard a lot about Hostgator so, here is your chance to try it for FREE!.

you can do for any plan and get one time $25off. I suggest you to sign-up for their most popular "Baby Plan".
which gives

UNLIMITED diskspace
UNLIMITED Bandwidth
UNLIMITED websites

One thing I can assure you with HG is, they are reliable provider with great uptime. you should defiantly try them at once.

This is completely free for first month, so you can try their services.

### [Update]


The domain is no longer free and hostgator is putting a charge for domain fees after you complete order. But still hosting is free. So I suggest you grab the offer and claim 1month of Unlimited hosting. else this might be gone too.
