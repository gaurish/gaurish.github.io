**B**SNL Broadband has released new broadband plans on occasion of [Deepavali.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diwali)They are bunch of new crap which is filled with FUP . I don't get a point behind rolling out unlimited plans with xxGB limit. It does not make sense other than fooling innocent customers.Bsnl, if you really want to put limits then don't call Unlimited. this was started by [Airtel ](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/2009/02/airtel-screws-unlimited-plan-users.html). now it seems other ISP incl bsnl is following.

Further, Downloading during Night Unlimited (200-800hrs) is no longer free on new plans. I sincerely hope that bsnl does not remove free night unlimited feature from its current plans.

And if you still want to see those "crappy plans". see below :

High Tariffs + Limited Unlimited Plan + Slow speedsÂ  = Sad State of Broadband in India :-( Desperately hoping for some Change
