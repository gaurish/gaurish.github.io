![.In Domains logo](https://www.namesbeyond.com/images/newnbc/index_155.jpg)You always wanted to buy a .IN domain but didn't by it because it was costly, today is the time. register .IN domains for just Rs.200 only. [Mitsu](http://mitsu.in) is registering IN Domains for Rs.200 for 1 year registration. Normal price of 1 year registration is Rs.700(approx).I already have brought couple of Domains from mitsu under this promotion, will buy a couple of more.

This promotion is started by [IN registry](http://www.registry.in), so expect other registrars to join in comming days. [PubDomains](http://www.pubdomains.in) Indian Chapter of [Directi](http://directi.com) has also started giving .IN domains for $4. mitsu is may be a new registrar for many, but they are 4th largest registrar of IN domains by sales volume. so i would suggest you to register with them. however if you don't trust them then you can register with [PubDomains](http://www.pubdomains.in).

.in is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for India. The domain is operated by IN Registry under the authority of NIXI, the National Internet Exchange of India. In recent times, .IN is gaining lot of importance as .com space has reached saturation. Finding a good name in .com space is next to impossible unless you buy from domain auctions. this is where .IN kicks in, its relatively new, so still many good names are available. if your website targets Indian audience. IN domain would be perfect for you.
