IN Shopping started a Series of Innovative Contest called [Friday Frenzy and Tuesday Tornado](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/2009/02/tuesday-tornado-get-sony-ericsson-f305-mobile-phone-for-just-8-rupees.html). This contest idea is similar to to [CrazyDeal](http://crazydeal.ipmart.com/) of Malaysioan E-commerce Site - IPmart. Under this a High Value item was given for a 1% of value of item whoever shops first.

Now, In case of IN shopping - the Site it didn't give much information about the winner apart from name. IPmart was kind enough to give order no and tracking details. Due to lack of information many people thought that [IN Shopping contest was fraud](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/2009/02/tuesday-tornado-get-sony-ericsson-f305-mobile-phone-for-just-8-rupees.html#comments). However it is to be noted In.com is a venture of Network18, which is a very big media group. It was direct attack on credibility of a famous organization, hence i decided to clear the air.

**GsLive:**Please share some tips on how to win this kind of contests
**Ankush Badola:**Timing , timing and timing. Be ready with the answer to the form that opens up. The faster you do it , the better your chances of winning. Remember I lost more than 6 times before I won. I would say if you can complete the complete transaction in under 30 seconds, then you have a chance. Internet connection speed matters, but it is limited by the your ability to fill the form. I would say anything above or equal to 512 Kbps connection should be good.

Now this is what I call luck, I myself tried more than 4times but Mr amit has won this in first try itself and that too with comparatively slower connection .  even Ankush with a Blazing fast connection had to try 6 times before he could win.Super lucky guy!

Congrats all the winners and thanks for IN shopping for this innovative contest!
