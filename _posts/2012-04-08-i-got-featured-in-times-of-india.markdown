I shared my views on GPS technology by a journalist. As everyone knows, I love to share my views on technology. Like little did I knew that it would end up in Major National Newspaper of Country - [Times of India](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/).

This article made into Times of India on march 11 2012, I got little delayed in posting it here. Not something big but it feels nice to read your name in paper upon waking up :)
