This is to inform all our readers that I have done complete overhaul of GaurishSharma.com with a complete backend change. If you have a loyal reader from a long time you would remember that site was running on Google’s Blogger Publishing platform with a custom domain. 

 

Now, the site is running on Open source Wordpress blogging software which is robust,more flexible and secure. Adding to it, I have changed the theme to give altogether new look.

 

I would utilize this opportunity to thank [jit](http://t.webofgoo.com), its because of him I was able to switch.he provided me with hosting space without charging a single penny.As for introduction, jit is a techie who is still unemployed and blogs at t._webofgoo_.com using pen name as “T”. After meeting him, I realized still there few people left in this world who are willing to share and help without expecting any favor in return. hats off to you jet, please don’t let anyone change you!

 

The migration is not fully complete yet, as i have tweak this Lemon Twist theme to my needs. if you notice any bugs or the site is not rendered correctly in your Browser. Please details as comments below or mail me at contact at gaurishsharma dot com.
