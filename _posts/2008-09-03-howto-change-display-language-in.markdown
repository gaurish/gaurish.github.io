When buying a laptop from abroad, the biggest problem is the OS comes in other languages than what we speak. same happened with me, my uncle got a Notebook computer with "Windows Vista Home basic" which had Chinese language by default.

Unlike Windows XP, changing display language is now a Premium feature and it only available in Windows Vista Business & Ultimate editions. now you don't want to be a pirate and same time change its language. after lot of searching I finally found a solution.

Here is How:

  * **[Download Vistalizator](http://www.froggie.sk/download.html)**** language change tool** - this tool allows you to change display language in Vista editions other than (officially supported) Ultimate, like Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium and Business.**[Download](http://www.froggie.sk/download.html)**
  * **[Download MUI Language Pack](http://www.froggie.sk/lp32sp1.html)** - **MUI** stands for Multilingual User Interface.  
There are **full** (100%) and **partial** (80% according to Microsoft) **MUI language packs**.Full languages change entire Vista environment, partial languages lack some localization. **[Download](http://www.froggie.sk/lp32sp1.html)**
  * Run Vistalizator, load a downloaded language pack, press Install  
  * Wait for the installation process and finally accept the display language change  
  * Exit program to restart Vista  
  * Enjoy the new language ![smiley](http://www.froggie.sk/img/smiley.gif)
  * You can install more languages and switch between them easily using Vistalizator
