We know Linux is a operating system where everything can be customized as tag line for linux is "Linux - We Have a Choice". this way a person can get a tailor made working environment which does all the tasks in his/her way,  he can schedule his daily encoding & downloading tasks,made custom keyboard shortcuts for his most used function.  
  
This generally  suits a single user Pc, but what about a system used by many persons in a single user account?, for them we need some customisations that does not need any prior expriance & comouter could be operated by use of common sense. now you would ask why use a single user account?, why not create accounts for every user. here are the reasons:-  
  
* It would require you to always log-on & log-off every now, which requires you to restart all your running applications. For example:while you are burning a DVD, your dad needs to check a important e-mail from his boss. his E-mail is configured on Evolution(default mail client for ubuntu), so he has to login his account and check email whereas you can't logoff as basaro can't be stopped in the middle.  
how convient it would have been if there was a single user account which would be suitable for all.  
  
* Remembering Userid & passwords is also a big project. we already have bank a/c,ATM pin,login details at work,internet banking userid & passwords and tons of other such details. who add one more to the never ending list?  
  
**Question :  
How to Manage a single user account which suits everyone in your family**  
  
  
Ans:  
Manage Thundebird & Firefox using Profile Manager  
Mozilla applications store your personal settings, added extensions and themes, and user data such as bookmarks, passwords, cookies and mail in a "profile". The Profile Manager allows you to create and manage profiles. With a new profile the application will run without any extensions, themes, or customized settings that may be causing problems, but you can still  import your data from another profile or switch back to a previous profile.
