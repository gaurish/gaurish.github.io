Orkut has started a new service called "**Orkut SMS**" by which you can receive latest scraps from your scrapbook as text sms on your Mobile. It means, now you would be able to get scraps from your orkut profile right onto your mobile phone. so it would work on crappiest mobile phones which don't have fancy features like GPRS or EDGE. Further you can also reply to scraps from your mobile itself.  
  
Its Advantage is that this service does not require GPRS connection on mobile. It is entirely SMS based.if you are looking for GPRS based service try http://m.orkut.com.  
  
It is to be noted that Receive SMS is entirely free but you would be Charged Rs.2/- per SMS(1/- for MTNL) for sending a SMS. In my opnion  the best utilization of service is to Receive scraps, sending scraps from mobile should be generally avoided unless urgent as its charged.

I am Using this on my Vodafone Mobile number from past week. I must say its very fast, i am getting scraps on SMS even before e-mail notifications.
