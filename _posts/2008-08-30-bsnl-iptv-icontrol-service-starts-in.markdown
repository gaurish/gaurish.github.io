Bsnl in association with askh optic fibre has kicked off Internet Protocol Television(IPTV) service under the brand name of *iControl*. There was a soft launch of this service earlier this month but it was not open for public till 28th Aug.Now the service is open to public.

Now your old useless LandLine telephone can now stream your favorite TV channels via Internet route, which basically means your TV would be more interactive,customizable and flexible. It should not be confused with Internet Television where you watch TV on your PC and pay to watch channels & Bandwidth. Under iControl, you only have to pay a fixed charge for Channels and bandwidth is free. The service is currently available in 4 cities. Delhi,Mumbai ,Jaipur, Jodhpur

Now we would try to have a look at this service and see which feature is most useful and which not so useful. Most important should you really take a IPTV connection

#### What is icontrol ?

icontrol is the new avtaar of television connection. It is a service that helps you control the television the way you want. And no it’s not DTH / Cable. TV that you know has changed. It no longer decides what you watch or when you watch. It doesn’t rule your world anymore. It can’t ask you to finish work by 8. It isn’t your master. It is your servant.  

### FEATURES OF iCONTROL

>   
**Video on demand**: More than 200 movies from Bollywood, Hollywood and Regional with REWIND, FAST FORWARD and PAUSE option. You can see a whole range of movies from Eros, Shemaroo. You don’t need a DVD Player or DVDs.

Since there are many scenes in movies which are too boring to watch or sometimes certain dialogs are unclear; imagine ability to rewind and forward while watching movies on your TV. probably you would feel this not a TV but your DVD player. as starting there are around 200 titles which are free to watch[ [Free Movies List](http://www.icontrol.in/Jaipur/vido-demand.asp) ] and other can be ordered by paying small amount of money.

>   
**Music on demand**: Which allows you to see your favorite music as and when you want.

In age of iPods, this feature not much useful according to me becuase to hear music you have to purchase it which I am sure not people would like to do.

>   
**Time Shift TV**: Which allows you to watch your favorite programs as and when you want. i.e. a subscriber can re-view past 3 days telecast program again.   
The time shift option is currently available for FTA (free to air) channels. However it will be soon made available on other channels. [ [FTA List](http://www.icontrol.in/Jaipur/time-shift.asp) ] 

Pretty handy, this basically means now you can watch your favorite television soaps 

>   
**A-Tube**: Video Classified pages offering you solutions to your day to day requirements from Lifestyle, Travel, Restaurants, Schools, Parlours, to even plumber. A-Tube and A-Shop allows subscribers to watch even video matrimonial, resumes and advertisements.   


Ahh..advertisements. why do they think we are stupid enough to take ads as a feature.don't burden us with ads, Please?

> PLAY GAMES WITH FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY  
Play a whole lot of interactive games like sudoku among your icontrol group.  




Not a big deal! I think its more usefull for kids i would instead pass my time doing something more productive.

> **Free Messaging**:  
Send and receive instant messages form other icontrol users. Make friends. Create your own address book.

Interesting.....maybe it can help me find a date. hehe   


> **Triple Play:**  
GO 3 IN 1: VOICE, DATA AND VIDEO  
icontrol, internet connection and telephone service on one single cord.  


Phone,Broadband and Television via your old landline. pretty neat 

> **Replay Live Channels**:  
Now, you can replay a live channel and watch cricket again and again and again.

Nice thing to have since you regularly miss your fav matches due angry boss.


##### What Channels are available?

Total of 135 channels including all popular channels like Sony,Star,Zee,Ten sports,colors,M TV etc are available.full channel list.[ [Channels List](http://www.icontrol.in/Jaipur/live-channels.asp) ] 

##### How much i have to Pay?

That's the most important Question. Service charges are Rs.150/- per month. there also one time activation charge of Rs.200/-. Installation & setop box are Free of charge. However a security deposit(Refundable) of Rs.999/- is to be paid towards set top box. you would be billed in your normal telephone bill.

##### What is disadvantage?

The most biggest disadvantage is that it requires a Broadband connection from BSNL.

##### Your Choice

If you already have Broadband connection, then IPTV is smart choice. otherwise DTH seems the best way to go.
