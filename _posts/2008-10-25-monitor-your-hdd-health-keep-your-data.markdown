My Computers stores tons of data and which is backed up regularly.But many people don't backup their data regularly saying that HDD seldom fails.As your PC is up more than 10hours a day, constantly downloading files or other Such actives with heavy Disk I/O.you never know when your HDD fails and you would hear a click-click sound of head crash. recently my friend lost his entire family photo collection, indeed said as all this childhood memories are now gone :(. there is nothing to worry about, just backup your precious data. you would do fine  

Here are 2 tools I use to constantly monitor my HDD's Health. you can also use them, so next time whenever your HDD fails you know it before.this is done using a Inbuilt feature in HDD's called S.M.A.R.T.More information here: [What is S.M.A.R.T. and how can we use it to avoid data disaster?](http://www.almico.com/sfarticle.php?id=2)
