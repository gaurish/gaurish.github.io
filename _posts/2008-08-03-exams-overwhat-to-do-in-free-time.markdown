My College Exams have ended few days back. There is still time to before new session of college Begins. this means sittings at home whole day and doing nothing. some people call it rest and means of relaxation. for me its simply waste of time. so thought to pen down some ideas which one could do and enjoy his/her holidays. after all we rarely get such long holidays.so I want to utilize it to fullest extent.  
  
  
  
Choice of activities that can be done in Holidays widely depends upon your hobbies/interest.I am listing a few which i prefer to pass my time.some of them might not appeal to you much.  
  
  
  
  
  


  * **Catch with Friends:** its been long since i met my friends. so i plan to visit their place. go on some outing with them. make sure you aren't unwanted guests, its your holiday not theirs. so call them and ask before visiting.  
  

  

  * **Watch Movies**:Thats most of us do when we are free, i plan to do the same. if you are looking for some good movies to watch.check out [Movie Recommendations](http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Recommendations/) @[imdb.com](http://imdb.com/)
  

  * **Hit the Gym:** In past few months due to continuous sittings while studying & daily midnight feasts, few extra layers of lipids have developed around my belly. now its time to shed it and get back in shape. if you don't have access to Gym,then do some jogging & running in park. if going to park is also not possible. you may try [Power Yoga.  
  
](http://www.rediff.com/getahead/2004/nov/05ga-power.htm)Its basically faster form of Yoga for youth.  
  

  

  * **Give Time to yourself:** In this crowded fast moving life, personnel space is at premium. this is the time where i can s pend time improving myself. Pursue my hobbies like reading magazines and novels. improve my dressing sense. catch up with latest fashion by shopping for trendy clothes & accesssories. get a funky look by new hair stlyle.you can do things which you always wanted to but were never able to do due to lack of time.
  

  * **Help your Parents**:Be responsible, spend some quality time with your Parents. help your dad with Car wash or Mom with daily chores. let them know they have a obedient son/daughter. they would be so happy. then maybe if you are little cunning then ask for a new mobile!! :D
  

  * **Sports**: It peaks performance and mental toughness. Although some people don't like  sports, but i am sure there must be at least one sport which you like playing. i like swimming.check the [List](http://www.rateitall.com/t-822-types-of-sports.aspx), to find which sport you may like.
  

  * **Games on Console/PC**:Playing computer Games is quite fun and addictive. i can spend whole night playing [GTA IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV).organise a LAN party with your friend and play counter strike. girls may not like this idea. Alternatively,Girls can callup friends and catch with latest gossip.
  

  * **Vacation**:leave behind the fast city life and escape to a exotic holiday destination. if you are life me, who can't go to holiday then visiting your Grandparents is the best thing to do. for me it refreshes my childhood memories.  
  

  

  * **Enchance your skill set**:not entirely fun, but you need to do something which enhances your professional value and this is the best time to do so.it may not be fun but certainly help to future. like i have decided to brush up my programming and learn basic math to improve my quantitative apptitude.you do something similar in your respective field. is you get too much stressed then to relieve stress <strike>watch some porno flick</strike>.no don't do that. i am joking. :P
  

  * Internet Surfing: waste your time watching [Youtube](http://youtube.com/) videos,reading my [blog](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/) or read site like [Wikipedia](http://wikipedia.com/) and participate in online discussion forums.you can spend time doing some some work or just passing time.on Internet its all upto you, how you spend your time.if you are looking for some sites. then [Google](http://google.com/) is your friend.
