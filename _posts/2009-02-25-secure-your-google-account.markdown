Almost everyone using Internet these days have atleast one Google Account.many people like me have multiple google accounts. your Google Account is the gateway to lots of services we use daily. to be able to use any google service you need a google account. the popular google services are Gmail - E-mail,Orkut - Social Networking,Blogger - Blogging,Youtube - Video Sharing,Adsense - Advertising  etc. these are a few to name but there would many more service you would be using.

Imagine the horror of waking up one day and finding that you cannot access your account, now you cannot check your E-mail or new scraps. Neither you can post to on your dear blogger blog or check how many clicks your blog generated yesterday. Even you Youtube Subscriptions updates are long gone! In Short a Total disaster !!
So our Google Account is very valuable to all of us and we should do everything possible to protect it.
Therefore I am going to list a few preventive & post-attacks measures you should take.


### **Preventive Action: **Some Common Tips to keep your account Secure





	
  * **Update Contact Information**: If you have created your account, long time back. there are chances that contact information that you provided at time of signing have been changed. Visit [Manage Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageAccount) and update all the information. Goto "_Change Security Question_" Option and Update Security Question to something which is uncommon and you would always remember. Also add a secondary E-mail Address if possible.

	
  * **Follow Google advice:** Read & Follow some Common tips given By Google. these are very basic tips and you may know it.[Keeping your account secure.](http://www.google.com/support/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=46526)

	
  * **Dig Deep into the Past**: Try to Remember when you first created this account. what all services you are using and since when. Account creation Date can be found via by making educated guesses, like I know my first google service was gmail. so date of welcome mail received from google, is date of google account creation. If you don't use gmail, then search your providers mailbox for "Google Email Verification" message, provided that you didn't delete that mail. now make a list of Services you use on your account and since when. Also note down google account creation dateÂ  Keep all this information written on a paper and keep it safe. I do realize that finding account creation date is hard, so don't worry Google also knows this fact. so you are only required to give Month and Year correct. dates can be approximate.

	
  * **Use Common Sense**: Always Follow some common tips like  keep away from links u get in messenger and other sites,avoid using your account on public computer as it might have keyloggers installed,always type the URL or use bookmarks, never click on Shortcuts you receive in e-mail, change your password at regular intervals etc.
