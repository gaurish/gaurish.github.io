##### Why Python?


Because using python you can do more in less time.Its syntax is easy; almost english like. its flexible and extendable. And has huge libraries which you can reuse instead of writing your own.This is the major reason Python is gaining traction.  It used for scripting in enterprise environments and it's used extensively by Google(youtube, App Engine), Even NASA uses it.
