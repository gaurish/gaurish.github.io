![broadband-logo](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/broadbandlogo.jpg) BSNL has once again reduced charges for broadband modems which it gives to its customers for using broadband service. this reduction is done on all modem types, with charges for rental & outright purchase being reduced.what’s surprising is, that this rate cut came without any formal announcement from Bsnl. the telecom giant has simply updated its broadband tariff page with reduced rates. Here are new rates:

 

## BSNL Broadband - Initial and other Charges

 

##### 

 

##### Modem Sale Price (One time charges)

 

**Modem Type Price**

 

Type-I Rs.1000      
Type-II Rs.1600       
Type-III Rs.1000       
Type-IV Rs.1600

 

    


 

##### Monthly Rental

 

**Modem Type Price**       
Type-I Rs.50       
Type-II Rs.80       
Type-III Rs.50       
Type-IV Rs.80

 

Earlier type-I & type-III modem’s sale price was Rs.1200/-, which is now Rs.1000/- and Price of Type-II & Type-IV was Rs.1800/-, which is now Rs.1600/-. so there is about Rs200 decrease .

 

We don’t know exactly when this charges are being reduced. But people tell me, this is done long time back, so it won’t be a new thing for many. Any rate cut from BSNL is welcome, so posting it here. Now I am Looking forward for more, cuts in future!
