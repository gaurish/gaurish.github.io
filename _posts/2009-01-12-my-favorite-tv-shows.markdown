I haven’t been updating this place as frequently as i used to do in earlier times. In my earlier posts, i have pointed out the reason as making a the correct balance. But actual reason is i spend most of my free time watching TV series. In other words, i am hooked to them.  

I am not talking about Indian TV shows like the _saas bahu_ crap or 43yr old man marring 16yr old girl , but TV shows telecasted in the US.In general, they have great storyline,fine performances from actors and mostly importantly they move as the plots change,actors gets replaced. Something which i miss on Indian television.   

Just like every tree in garden doesn’t yield fruits, same way not all TV series telecasted are interesting to watch. i would start from ones which i like the most.

The show was created by [Craig Thomas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Thomas_%28screenwriter%29) and [Carter Bays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Bays). As a [framing device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_device), the main character, [Ted Mosby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Mosby), in the year 2030 recounts to his son and daughter the events that led to his meeting their mother, which explains the title and allows for a narration in the past tense. _How I Met Your Mother_'s other main characters are [Marshall Eriksen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Eriksen), [Robin Scherbatsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Scherbatsky), [Barney Stinson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson), and [Lily Aldrin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Aldrin). Thomas and Bays drew from their friendship in creating the characters, with Ted based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily based loosely on Thomas and his wife.  





The above 4 shows are the my favorite ones, other than that i watch Dexter,24,[Supernatural](http://www.orkut.co.in/UniversalSearch.aspx?q=%22SuperNatural%22). but didn’t like them much.  

the next question is How do i get this shows here in INDIA? Answer: via Peer-to-peer networks like [TPB](http://thepiratebay.com/). as legally you can’t get them here.  

Now, Go watch it as the risk of being addicted!!
