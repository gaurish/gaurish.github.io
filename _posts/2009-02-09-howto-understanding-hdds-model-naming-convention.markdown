Ever wondered why Hard drive model carry 10-14digit string, why not simple names. because model number of a hard drive can say lot of information about it e.g storage capacity,cache size & connector interface.storage companies use a set of conventions

Understanding a model no. would help you know about features of it by simply checking it label & you would no longer have to be dependent on not-so-informed salesman in your local shop. many times there are different model no. of exact same capacity but they differ in cache size which has a direct result on performance. more cache means faster performance

Now we will try to understand model number of various hard drives from different manufacturers.

Note: i would discuss only about consumer series internal hard drives from popular manufacturers. discussing others are beyond the scope of this guide.

**Where do i find model no?**
Its written clearly on faceplate of hard drive with bold characters along the serial no and other information like date of manufacturing etc.

1)**Seagate**

sample model number:ST3500630AS
we break is as: ST-3-500-6-30-AS



	
  * ST: Company initials. ST= "Seagate Technology", STM -   Seagate Technology Maxtor(Maxtor Hard drive).

	
  * 3: Form factor. 3 = Standard 3.5" inch drives; 9 = 2.5" inch Laptop drive.

	
  * 500: Total Capacity in Gigabytes(1000mb = 1GB). this is a 500GB model.

	
  * 6:Cache Size. 0 = 2MB, 2 = 2MB, 3 = 8MB,4 = 16MB, 6 = 16MB and  8 = 8MB. Note:the **cache** is the buffer memory between the controller and the mechanical **hdd**. the more **cache** it has - the more data it can store to transmit off to the controller. the faster data access on the **hdd** will be.please don't confuse it with CPU Cache.

	
  * AS: Connector Interface type, A= 40pin PATA or IDE and AS=SATA interface.

we break it as: WD-640-0-A-A-K-S

WD:Company initials

640: drive capacity in Gigabytes. its a 640GB drive

A:Form factor.

A:Brand/Series

K:RPM/Buffer Size or Attribute
S:Interface Type
