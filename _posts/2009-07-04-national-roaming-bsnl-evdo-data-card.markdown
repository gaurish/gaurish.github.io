![BSNL_EVDO](http://www.gaurishsharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/evdo4-99x150.jpg)A good news for all Bsnl Evdo & NIC card customers. BSNL has listened to you and have enabled national roaming on Evdo/NIC data cards. According to a [announcement on BSNL's website](http://bsnl.in/newsdetailed.php?news_id=473) romaing is now available all customer without paying any extra charges by default; subject to network feasibility.

Now you can take your data card anywhere in India and browse internet, the only condition is that area should have a CDMA network nearby. earlier, bsnl data card(NIC/EvDO) only used to work in subscribers home state. this feature makes bsnl data a true Internet-on-Go Solution. till now anyone needing national roaming had to depend on upon their crawling GPRS connections or internet card from TataÂ  & Reliance which costs a bomb compared to bsnl affordable data card. By enabling romaing is trying to compete with private telecom operators who provide nationwide wireless data service.

**Now The Bad news is:**
Bsnl has hiked monthly rentals by 15% for all customers. this hike is effective immediate for new customers. for existing customers, there is no change for now and would count getting billed at old price. but after six months; from January 2010. they would be burdened with increased prices.the revised rentals are as under :
