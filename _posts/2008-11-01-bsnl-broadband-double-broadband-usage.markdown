Subscribers of Unlimited plan would be disappointed, as there no double bandwidth offer for them. This offer is is applicable all over india, however your local exchange might deny this as they must not received "official communication" regarding this. For the record, here is the official Letter that BSNL Head office, Delhi is sending to all its circle offices. This letter is signed by P.K.Shah,DGM (Broadband Service,BSNL.Corporate Office.  so this is should be enough proof.  

  

If Bsnl still denies your free usage, take Print-out of below letter and show it to concerned officials. Surely, they can't deny a official Letter :D
