For my Non-hindi speaking friends, this Translates into "_Do you have Internet Explorer in CD_".

here is a Brief conversation a Girl & Guy at some college situated at [Jaipur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaipur):

(_a Girl wearing pink top and pale blue jeans Walks up to guy, Armed with hair comb in one hand and a laptop on shoulder. she unfolds her hair & ties it again for unknown reasons.the guy is busy reading [LFYMag](http://www.lfymag.com/). Just then Girl Breaks his concentration and demands immediate attention. _)

Boy:Yes?

Girl(in a casual manner):Hi, Internet Explorer _ki_ CD _hai kya_?

Boy(puzzled):eh?

Girl(Firmly):you don't know what is internet explorer?

Boy: No, Please enlighten me.

Girl: its a Operating system.

Boy: Yes, IE is world greatest Os, it would be its insult to the-greatest-OS, if it was to be distributed in cheepo Media/CDs

Girl(puzzled):  Then how do i Install Internet Explorer in Vista?

Boy(Singals her to open laptop): It appears magically when a User wants to use it and disappears when not in use.

Girl: i think so, as till yesterday there it was a blue  "E" icon on my Desktop. now it has disappeared since i am not using it.how do i call it back?

Guy:close your eyes and wait for magic.

_Meanwhile he restores deleted shortcut from recycle bin and Internet Explorer Icon  appears on desktop.
_

Girl:wow, you are so good with Computers. amazing!

Guy:err....what did i do?

_Girl says Thank you and walks off. Guy resumes reading an article about Python programming in _[_LFYMag_](http://www.lfymag.com/)
