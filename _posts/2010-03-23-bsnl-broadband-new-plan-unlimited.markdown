However, At this point its not known that its applicable all over India or valid only in Chennai telecom circle.also, it does not say if [Fair-Usage-Policy](http://afup.broadbandforum.in/) is applicable or not. so readers are advised to confirm it.

**[Update]**

This plan has a fair usage limit applied on all plans, once you cross that data usage your speed would be reduced to 256kbps, which bad. So I would advise you against these plans
