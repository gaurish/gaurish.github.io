#### Domaining


Domaining is the business of buying, selling, developing and monetizing Internet domain names. In simply language you look for look for strong commercial keywords domains and develop them into websites for purpose of making money.now what would be strong commercial keywords? Simple, The common terms for which people search everyday like _creditcard.com,sex.com,buy.com_ but wait aren't all these registered already? yes they are but there are tons of others waiting to be discovered by you. My suggestion if you look into country code extensions like .IN,.CO.UK as [gTLD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain) market(.COM,.NET,.ORG) is currently saturated. [ccTLDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain) are the future!  To succeed in this business you need little smartness and lots of luck!Best thing you about this method is you don't need have to invest lots of money - one could start small. domain registration rates are start $8USD(Rs.450) depending upon on extension.

One thing most people do is confuse [Cyber squatting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting) with Domaining. Both are completely different; the main differences are: Domaininers always avoid Trademarks and develop sites whereas cyber squatters simply register Trademark/copyrighted names with no intention of development.

If you want start of as a Domainer refer to Guide [How to Get Started as a Domainer](http://www.avivadirectory.com/domain/)

#### Affiliate marketing


Affiliate Marketing is another term for Cost Per Action(CPA) Advertising. This is a form of advertising where the advertiser pays based on specified actions taken by the end user. Some examples would be filling out a form after clicking on the ad or purchasing a product after clicking on the ad.
